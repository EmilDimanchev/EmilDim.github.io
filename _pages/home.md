I research energy systems and the effects of climate and energy policies, using methods primarily from operations research. I am especially interested in addressing practical challenges in climate policy making and energy system planning by collaborating across disciplines. 

## Bio

Emil Dimanchev is a scientist specializing in climate policy. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Princeton [ZERO Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/mission-people/emil-dimanchev/). His work focuses on improving the design of climate and energy policies and on evaluating strategies for transitioning energy systems toward net-zero energy. He was previously a research associate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/). In this role, he testified before state legislators on renewable energy policy and conducted power systems research that informed regional transmission planning. Formerly, he was a climate policy analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, where he played a leading role in producing the go-to analysis used by legislators and government officials to design reforms of the EU Emissions Trading System that raised the EU carbon price from €10 to €100 per ton CO_2. Emil holds a PhD in Electric Power Engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), a M.S. in Technology and Policy from MIT, and a B.A. in Mathematical Economics from Colorado College. He currently also serves as a consultant for [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com).
