I research energy systems and the effects of climate and energy policies, using methods primarily from operations research. I am especially interested in addressing practical challenges in climate policy making and energy system planning by collaborating across disciplines. 

## Bio

I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Princeton ZERO Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/mission-people/emil-dimanchev/). My work focuses on improving the design of energy systems, electricity markets, and climate policies. I was previously a research associate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a climate policy analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon. I have advised and testified before legislators and government officials on energy policy in the EU and the US, including on the EU Emissions Trading System, renewable energy policy and power system planning. I have a PhD in electric power engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), an MS in technology and policy from MIT, and a BA in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books of various genres (especially sci-fi), climbing, and cross-country skiing.
