I research energy systems and the effects of climate and energy policies, using methods primarily from operations research. I am especially interested in addressing practical challenges in climate policy making and energy system planning by collaborating across disciplines. 

## Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Princeton ZERO Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a consultant for [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com). 

In previous roles, I was a Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators and advised government officials on climate policy in the U.S. and the European Union. I advised on the reform of the E.U. Emissions Trading System and my work has been featured in EU Parliament and European Commission hearings, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I have a PhD in electric power engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), a MS in technology and policy from MIT, and a BA in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books of various genres (especially sci-fi), climbing, and cross-country skiing.
