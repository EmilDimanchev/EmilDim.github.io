title: Hello

I research energy systems and the effects of climate and energy policies, using methods primarily from operations research. I am especially interested in addressing practical challenges in climate policy making and energy system planning by collaborating across disciplines. 

## Bio

Emil Dimanchev is a postdoctoral research associate at the Princeton [ZERO Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/mission-people/emil-dimanchev/). His work focuses on improving the design of energy systems, electricity markets, and climate policies. He was previously a research associate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), during which time he testified before state legislators on renewable energy policy and conducted power system planning research that informed regional transmission expansion. Formerly, he was a climate policy analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, where he advised legislators and government officials on the reform of the EU Emissions Trading System. Emil holds a PhD in Electric Power Engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), a M.S. in Technology and Policy from MIT, and a B.A. in Mathematical Economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books of various genres (especially sci-fi), climbing, and cross-country skiing.
