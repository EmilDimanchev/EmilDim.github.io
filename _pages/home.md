I work on improving the design of energy systems and climate policy using mathematical modeling primarily from the field of operations research. I am especially interested in addressing practical challenges in climate policy making and energy system planning by collaborating across disciplines. 

## Bio

Emil Dimanchev is a scientist specializing in climate and energy policy. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Princeton [ZERO Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/mission-people/emil-dimanchev/). His work focuses on improving the design of energy policies and evaluating strategies for transitioning energy systems toward net-zero energy. He was previously a research associate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/). In this role, he testified before state legislators on renewable energy policy and conducted power systems research that informed regional transmission planning. He previously spent 5 years as a climate policy analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon. There, he served as a lead modeler for go-to analyses used by EU legislators and government officials to design reforms for the EU Emissions Trading System, which drove the EU carbon price from €10 to €100. Emil holds a PhD in Electric Power Engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), a MSc in Technology and Policy from MIT, and a BA in Mathematical Economics from Colorado College. He currently also serves as a consultant for [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com).
