I study macro-energy systems and the effects of climate and energy policies. My research addresses these topics using methods primarily from operations research. I am especially interested in questions encountered in the practice of climate policy making and in approaches that leverage collaboration across disciplines. My recent work draws on energy systems engineering, environmental economics, finance, game theory, and political science.

## Bio

I am currently a Researcher at the Industrial Economics and Technology Management Deparment of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/iot/bedok#/view/about)) and a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/). I also work with [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com) as one of their "superforecasters". 

In previous roles, I was a Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators and advised government officials on climate policy in the U.S. and the European Union. I advised Members of the European Parliament and member state officials on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System. My work was featured in EU Parliament and European Commission hearings, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books of various genres (especially sci-fi), climbing, and cross-country skiing.
