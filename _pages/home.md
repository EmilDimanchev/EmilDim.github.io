I investigate climate policy design, energy system planning, and energy market economics. I am especially interested in questions encountered in the practice of climate policy making, or informed by perspectives from political science, finance, or natural science. I leverage methods primarily from operations research, economics, and engineering. 

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electric power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/emil.dimanchev)), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com). 

In previous roles, I was a Senior Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators and advised government officials on climate policy in the U.S. and the European Union. I advised Members of the European Parliament and member state officials on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System. My work was featured in EU Parliament and European Commission hearings, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books, climbing, and cross-country skiing.
