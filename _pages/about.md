## Research

My research investigates climate policy design, energy system planning, and energy market economics. I am especially interested in questions encountered in the practice of climate policy making, or informed by perspectives from political science, finance, or natural science. I leverage methods primarily from operations research, economics, and engineering. 

## PhD project

My PhD focuses on the impact of investment risk on the clean energy transition and the role of public policy. I am developing stochastic optimization models that address these questions in the contexts of power system planning and EV charging station investments. 

The first [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527831425.ch8) of my PhD reviews the range of electrification pathways consistent with 2C and 1.5C climate targets. We find that pathways consistently show substantial electrification, but 2C pathways disagree on the magnitude. Using fleet turnover modeling, we show that the median pathway requires an acceleration of electric vehicle sales and of the retirement of internal combustion engine vehicles. 

The second [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) of my PhD investigates how policy can accelerate investment in EV charging stations by accounting for the risks faced by private-sector investors using real options modeling. In my third [project](https://www.aiee.it/iaee_2023/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/130Dimanchev_abstract.pdf), I am exploring how power system decarbonization is impacted by investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets. For this purpose I am developing new game theoretic equilibrium methods for power system generation expansion.

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electric power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/emil.dimanchev)), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com). 

In previous roles, I was a Senior Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators and advised government officials on climate policy in the U.S. and the European Union. I advised Members of the European Parliament and member state officials on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System. My work was featured in EU Parliament and European Commission hearings, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books, climbing, and cross-country skiing.
