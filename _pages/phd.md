My PhD research investigated the ability of electricity markets to incentivize socially-optimal investment decisions, and the implications of long-term contracting problems for low-carbon energy systems. My [thesis](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3165055) consisted of four papers focusing on the following questions:

* How do investments in power system technologies depend on market risk and the incompleteness of long-term contracting in liberalized power markets, and what implications does this have for power system emissions? [Paper link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639).
* How do climate policy effects change when risk markets are incomplete? [Paper link](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993).
* How does the optimal choice of renewable subsidies and carbon prices change in power markets with incomplete risk trading? [Paper link]((https://ceepr.mit.edu/workingpaper/choosing-climate-policies-in-a-second-best-world-with-incomplete-markets-insights-from-a-bilevel-power-system-model/)).
* How does risk impact the timing of EV infrastructure investments and how can government policies accelerate deployment? [Paper link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884).

To shed light on these questions, I developed stochastic optimization and equilibrium models, including an equilibrium approach to modeling investments in liberalized power systems, a game theoretic model of the interactions between an electricity market and a government seeking to reduce emissions, and a real options model of EV charging investments.
