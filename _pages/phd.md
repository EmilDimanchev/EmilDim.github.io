My PhD focused on the role of investment risk in power systems, its consequences for societal climate goals, and its implications for public policy. I set out to address the following questions:

* How does power system decarbonization depend on investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets ([Dimanchev et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639))?
* How do [climate policy effects](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) change when risk markets are incomplete?
* How does the optimal choice of renewable subsidies and carbon prices change in power markets with incomplete risk trading?
* How does risk impact the timing of [EV infrastructure investments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) and how can government policies accelerate deployment?

To shed light on these questions, I developed stochastic optimization and equilibrium methods, including an equilibrium approach to modeling generation expansion in liberalized power systems, a game theoretic model of the interactions between an electricity market and a government seeking to reduce emissions, and a real options model of EV charging investments.
