My PhD focuses on the role of investment risk in power systems, its consequences for societal climate goals, and its implications for public policy. My thesis sets out to shed light on the following questions:

* How does power system decarbonization depend on investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets ([Dimanchev et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639))?
* How do [climate policy effects](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) change when risk markets are incomplete?
* How does the optimal choice of renewable subsidies and carbon prices change in power markets with incomplete risk trading?
* How does risk impact the timing of [EV infrastructure investments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) and how can government policies accelerate deployment?
