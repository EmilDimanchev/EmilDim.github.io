My [PhD](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3165055) investigated risk allocation problems in electricity markets, their consequences for societal climate goals, and their implications for public policy, with a focus on the following questions:

* How does [power system decarbonization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639) depend on investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets?
* How do [climate policy effects](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) change when risk markets are incomplete?
* How does the [optimal choice of renewable subsidies](https://ceepr.mit.edu/workingpaper/choosing-climate-policies-in-a-second-best-world-with-incomplete-markets-insights-from-a-bilevel-power-system-model/) and carbon prices change in power markets with incomplete risk trading?
* How does risk impact the timing of [EV infrastructure investments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) and how can government policies accelerate deployment?

To shed light on these questions, I developed stochastic optimization and equilibrium methods, including an equilibrium approach to modeling generation expansion in liberalized power systems, a game theoretic model of the interactions between an electricity market and a government seeking to reduce emissions, and a real options model of EV charging investments.
