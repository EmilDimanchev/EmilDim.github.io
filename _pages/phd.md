## Research

My research investigates climate policy design, energy system planning, and energy market economics. I am especially interested in questions encountered in the practice of climate policy making, or informed by perspectives from political science, finance, or natural science. I leverage methods primarily from operations research, economics, and engineering. 

## PhD project

My PhD focuses on the impact of investment risk on the clean energy transition and the role of public policy. I am developing stochastic optimization models that address these questions in the contexts of power system planning and EV charging station investments. 

The first [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527831425.ch8) of my PhD reviews the range of electrification pathways consistent with 2C and 1.5C climate targets. We find that pathways consistently show substantial electrification, but 2C pathways disagree on the magnitude. Using fleet turnover modeling, we show that the median pathway requires an acceleration of electric vehicle sales and of the retirement of internal combustion engine vehicles. 

The second [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) of my PhD investigates how policy can accelerate investment in EV charging stations by accounting for the risks faced by private-sector investors using real options modeling. In my third [project](https://ceepr.mit.edu/workingpaper/consequences-of-the-missing-risk-market-problem-for-power-system-emissions/), I am exploring how power system decarbonization is impacted by investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets. For this purpose I am developing new game theoretic equilibrium methods for power system generation expansion.
