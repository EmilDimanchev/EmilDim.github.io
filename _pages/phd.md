My PhD focuses on the role of investment risk in power systems, its consequences for societal climate goals, and its implications for public policy. I explore these topics by developing stochastic optimization and equilibrium operations research models.

My main [project](https://ceepr.mit.edu/workingpaper/consequences-of-the-missing-risk-market-problem-for-power-system-emissions/) explores how power system decarbonization is impacted by investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets. In another work, I explore how [climate policy effects](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) change when risk markets are incomplete.

I and co-authors also investigated how policy can accelerate [investment in EV charging stations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) by accounting for the risks faced by private-sector investors using real options modeling. 

To better understand the importance of future power system investments, in another publication I also [reviewed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527831425.ch8) the range of electrification pathways consistent with 2C and 1.5C climate targets. This work found that pathways consistently show substantial electrification, but 2C pathways disagree on the magnitude.
