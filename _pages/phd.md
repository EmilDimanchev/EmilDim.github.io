My PhD focuses on the role of investment risk in power systems, its consequences for societal climate goals, and its implications for public policy. This research explored the following questions:

* How power system decarbonization depends on investor risk aversion and the incompleteness of risk markets ([Dimanchev et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639)).
* How [climate policy effects](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) change when risk markets are incomplete.
* The optimal choice of renewable subsidies and carbon prices in power markets with incomplete risk trading.
* How policy can accelerate [investment in EV charging stations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) by accounting for the risks faced by private-sector investors using real options modeling.
