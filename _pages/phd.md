My [PhD research](https://nva.sikt.no/registration/0198ebcba8c4-9471e9dd-d1d4-40e6-b383-80f09b98fcbb) assessed the ability of electricity markets to incentivize socially-optimal investment decisions, with a particular focus on how electricity markets allocate risk between investors and consumers, and how risk affects investments in different power system technologies. 

My first PhD [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639) showed that electricity markets have a tendency to distort investments in favor of fossil fuels. To correct such distortions, this research suggests improved long-term market mechanisms that address current inefficiencies in risk allocation.

In [later](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) [work](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5636369), I found that existing climate policies indirectly counteract risk-related inefficiencies in current electricity markets. Climate policies may thus be more economically beneficial than previously thought.

My work also showed that [renewable subsidies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5636369) may be more cost-effective than suggested by previous work, because of how strongly they counteract inefficiencies in current electricity markets.
