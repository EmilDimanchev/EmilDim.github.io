My [PhD research](https://nva.sikt.no/registration/0198ebcba8c4-9471e9dd-d1d4-40e6-b383-80f09b98fcbb) investigated how risk impacts the functioning and optimal design of low-carbon energy systems. I assessed the ability of electricity markets to incentivize socially-optimal investment decisions, with a particular focus on how electricity markets allocate risk between investors and consumers, and how risk affects investments in different power system technologies. 

My first PhD [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639) showed that electricity markets have a tendency to distort investments in favor of fossil fuels. This tendency results from inefficiencies in how electricity markets allocate risk. This research suggests that electricity markets should be re-designed to make sure they are not misaligned with public decarbonization goals, and to improve the efficiency of low-carbon electricity systems. 

In [later](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.94993) [work](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5636369), I showed that existing climate policies indirectly counteract risk-related inefficiencies in current electricity markets. This means that climate policies may be more economically beneficial than previously thought, and argues in favor of [strengthening](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5636369) existing policies. In my third PhD [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5636369), I also found that renewable subsidies may be more economically efficient than previously estimated because they counteract risk allocation inefficiencies relatively strongly. 

Finally, I explored how risk impacts the timing of EV infrastructure investments. My [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884) showed that charging infrastructure incentives that account for risk are substantially more cost-effective than the traditional subsidy design found in most countries.
