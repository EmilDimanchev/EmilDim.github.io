I study macro-energy systems and how they can be transitioned toward net-zero carbon energy. My research focuses on the following three topics:

1. Where do we want to go: Assessing the performance of alternative net-zero energy system design optionsa and generating future scenarios for actionable planning guidance.
2. How do we get there: Evaluating climate and energy policies for steering socio-technical systems toward net-zero. 
3. How do we know: Advancing state-of-the-art methods for modeling socio-technical systems with a particular focus on high-resolution policy modeling under political economy constraints and uncertainty.

I leverage new fit-for-purpose mathematical programming methods that draw on operations research, engineering, and economics. In particular, I develop systems methods for modeling highly-renewable energy systems where electricity plays a central role, with a focus on capacity expansion and energy system optimization and equilibrium models.
