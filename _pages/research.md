I work on improving our understanding of macro-energy systems and energy policy effects to provide actionable guidance for the transition toward net-zero carbon energy. My research focuses on the following three topics:

1. Where do we want to go? Guiding planning decisions in energy systems and understanding the implications of alternative net-zero energy system design options.
2. How do we get there? Evaluating climate and energy policies for steering economies toward net-zero. 
3. How do we know? Advancing state-of-the-art methods for modeling socio-technical systems with a particular focus on high-resolution policy modeling under political economy constraints and uncertainty.

I leverage new fit-for-purpose mathematical programming methods that draw on operations research, engineering, and economics. In particular, I develop systems methods capable of modeling highly-renewable energy systems where electricity plays a central role, including capacity expansion and energy system optimization and equilibrium models.
