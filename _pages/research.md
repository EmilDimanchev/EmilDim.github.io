## Overview 

I study macro-energy systems and how they can be transitioned toward net-zero carbon energy. 

My research focuses on the following three topics:

1. Where do we want to go: Assessing the performance of alternative net-zero energy system design options and generating future scenarios for actionable planning guidance.
2. How do we get there: Evaluating climate and energy policies for steering socio-technical systems toward net-zero. 
3. How do we know: Advancing state-of-the-art optimization-based methods for modeling energy systems with a particular focus on high-resolution policy modeling under political economy constraints and uncertainty.

## Approaches

The transition to net-zero carbon energy presents significant research and modeling challenges:
* Future energy systems will not look like today's but be increasingly reliant on weather-dependent renewable resources and electrification. Understanding future systems requires fit-for-purpose electricity-centric optimization-based methods.
* Policy makers have a limited set of levers at their disposal to meet multiple objectives but this is often ignored in traditional modeling efforts.
* The second-best nature of national economies belies traditional models built on the assumption of efficient markets. Energy transitions are shaped by market failures, adoption-driven innovation, and network effects. 

To address these challenges, I leverage new mathematical programming methods that draw on operations research, engineering, and economics, with a particular focus on capacity expansion and energy system optimization and equilibrium models. My work has shown how such methods can be enhanced to inform complex policy choices[^1], market inefficiencies[^2], and my ongoing work is extending current methods for capturing learning-by-doing and multi-sector network interactions[^3].
