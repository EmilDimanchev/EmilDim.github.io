I study macro-energy systems and how they can be transitioned toward net-zero carbon energy. 

## Questions

My research focuses on the following three topics:
1. Where do we want to go: Assessing the performance of alternative net-zero energy system design options and generating future scenarios for actionable planning guidance, particularly under uncertainty. Example works: [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421521002391), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X25000276), [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/ad763e).
2. How do we get there: Evaluating climate and energy policies for steering socio-technical systems toward desired system states. Example works: [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab31d9), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323001950), [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639), [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae0052), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002884).
3. How do we know: Advancing state-of-the-art optimization-based methods for modeling energy systems with a particular focus on high-resolution policy modeling under political economy constraints. Example works: [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107639), [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5636369).

## Challenges

Addressing these problems requires research that overcomes the following challenges:
* Structural transformations: Future energy systems will not look like today's but be increasingly reliant on weather-dependent renewable resources and electrification. Understanding future systems thus increasingly requires electricity-centric models based on optimization methods.
* Bringing policy modeling from theory to reality: Policy makers have a limited set of levers at their disposal to meet multiple objectives while facing political constraints. This requires policy modeling beyond traditional approaches based on theoretical uniform carbon prices.
* Decision making in a sub-optimal world: The second-best nature of national economies stands in contrast to traditional models built on the assumption of efficient markets. As energy transitions are shaped by market failures, adoption-driven innovation, and network effects, there is a growing need for fit-for-purpose analytical methods.

## Solutions

I leverage new mathematical programming methods that draw on operations research, engineering, and economics, with a particular focus on capacity expansion and energy system optimization and equilibrium models. My work has introduced enhanved versions of such methods to inform policy choices between multiple instruments considering objectives beyond efficiency[^1], and shown the importance of market inefficiencies for climate policy design[^2]. My ongoing work is extending current methods for capturing learning-by-doing and multi-sector network interactions[^3].
